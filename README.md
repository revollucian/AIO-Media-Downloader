YouTube and Soundcloud media downloader that doesn't use API keys.

Here are some of the features:

*‚òÑÔ∏è This tool lets you download both videos and audio files off of the YouTube platform. This also includes entire playlists of videos and audio files.

*üåô You can also download SoundCloud tracks and playlists/albums. The tool automatically downloads the artwork of each track or playlist you input as well.

*üåö The built-in search feature lets you look for songs without the need of opening your browser and quering YouTube itself. The "Send URL to downloader" button automatically fetches the URL of the song/video youre looking for and inputs it in both the downloader URL fields.

Downloaded ```.mp3``` files can be found in the "audios" directory, ```.mp4's``` inside the "videos" directory and all artwork ```.jpeg``` files go into the "artworks" directory.
